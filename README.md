# Petition System

This petition system, inspired by [We the People](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/) on wh.gov, is my graduation project. It is intended to be an alternative to the existing Letters to the College Administration system on [Shenzhen University's intranet](www.szu.edu.cn).

The system uses JavaScript to handle everything:

* Node & Express.js - backend fundamentals
* Pug - template engine
* Passport.js - authentication
* MongoDB & Mongoose - database
* webpack - asset bundler
