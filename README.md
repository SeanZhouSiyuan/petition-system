# Petition System

This petition system, inspired by [We the People](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/) on whitehouse.gov, is my graduation project. It is intended to be an alternative to the existing [Letters to the College Administration](http://http://www1.szu.edu.cn/view.asp?id=95) system on Shenzhen University's intranet.

The system uses JavaScript to handle just about everything:

* Node & Express.js - backend fundamentals
* Pug - template engine
* Passport.js - authentication
* MongoDB & Mongoose - database
* webpack - asset bundler
